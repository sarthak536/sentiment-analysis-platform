Samsung Galaxy J7 J700M 16GB Dual Sim LTE Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White (International Version),Samsung,227.14,5,"Purchased this because I liked my old Galaxy S3 and just did not want to spend the money for the newer Galaxy S line. It is a good phone, great battery life from my perspective, and charges fast. I just popped in my sim card from my S3 phone (AT&T carrier). There was a wizard-type setup that led me through configuring it, and it offered the opportunity to re-install my old apps. You definitely want to take the option to edit on this one and deselect any old stuff that you don't use anymore (or that was bloatware installed by your carrier). If you want lots of detail about this phone, look for a reviewer named Daisy. Daisy provided great information and that is what gave me the confidence to take the plunge to buy this phone. I've had my phone for a little over a month and there are no problems. (The only thing that was a little tricky to get going again was my visual voicemail, but that was resolved by resetting my password and setting it up from scratch.) Based on my experience with this phone, we will go with the J line for future phone replacements in my family. Tip: You can see some variant of the J7 if you go to a T.mobile store. I did that because I wanted to experience the size/weight in hand before I purchased. BTW, when you are looking for accessories, you need to know whether this phone is a ""2015"" or a ""2016"". It's a 2015, based on the processor (Octa Core 1.5GHz) identified on the plastic screen overlay it shipped with.",0

Nokia C1-01 Unlocked GSM Phone--US Version with Warranty (Dark Grey),Nokia,269.1,3,"This is the second time I have purchased this phone. The first time was for use in Africa but I found out that it was not opened for use in that part of the world which was a disappointment. This time I needed it for use with my simple mobile. It works well but unfortunately I cannot access the internet which is a negative. Overall, I like the phone and it serves it purpose. It is simple, the volume is excellent and I can also store my music on a microchip which does not come with the phone, but which I bought separately. Hope this helps.",0

Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge G9350 32GB HK DUAL SIM Factory Unlocked GSM International Version no warranty (BLUE CORAL),Samsung,616.99,5,"As soon as i got this i have yet to put it down, SUPER FAST, AMAZING SCREEN, its the dream phone i have been waiting for. Easy to transfer my data to the new phone, very thing and light, when i first held it i was like ""omg this thing is super light"" like i would drop it forgetting about the weight of it lol Only thing i was ""eh"" on about getting it was the seal was detached from the box(wasn't broken but the adhesive was rubbed off from shipping/warehouse), and the branding that usually says ""S7 Edge"" on the back is not on this model which i think is a good thing but made me feel for about an hour ""man i got a fake"" but it was not the case at all, it felt like the real deal. I checked the settings and the software is super snappy and easy to use, in the ""about phone"" section of settings it does say model number and the phone type as what it was advertised.PRO:~Amazing screen~Great build~Wireless Charging/Water Resistant(i have tried the water resistance and i say it works, had residue from the stickers and so i ran under tap water and cleaned that right off)(i have yet to try wireless charging yet)NEUTRAL:~Battery(it seems great but at the same time not so great. I woke up at 7am with 100% and then by 8:45am its at 85% so i still great but i feel by the end of the night ill have 10% left or less. I am a heavy user when it comes to my phone)CON:~Charger it comes with is foreign(my seller gave me an adapter with my phone, but i don't know if that's every purchase so be well aware it MAY NOT come with an American Adapter)As far as i can tell that's about it so far, i will update my review when and if anything changes. Yet to test wireless charging but plan on picking one up soon and will add an edit to this.",4
BLU Energy X Plus Smartphone - With 4000 mAh Super Battery- US GSM Unlocked - Grey,BLU,139,5,"Got this phone through Amazon prime and they delivered in the time frame they promised. First off, I would like to say that I'm an avid user of smart devices and had my fair share of smart phones. The one phone I used a lot was the Samsung Galaxy S3. I loved this phone it ran smoothly, the camera was amazing and it was durable. Let me start off by saying I wanted to upgrade my phone again but was getting tired of forking out hundreds of dollars so I began my search for a device that would live up to my standards and not cost me an arm and a leg along the way. I started researching and talking to friends and came across the company BLU. Long story short I found the Energy X Plus and fell in love with the specs on paper. 4,000 mAh battery, huge 5.5"" screen, 8 MP camera this phone had amazing specs. Now when I received my phone I admit I was worried because like most people I've never heard of BLU and was skeptical after all anyone could write nice specs and call it a day. I'm here to tell you now that this phone doesn't just sound good on paper it's actually amazing in person as well. The screen is 5.5"" HD which through me off because it's not SUPER AMOLED and to be honest there is a slight color difference but nothing to complain about at all. In fact if I had to search for one thing I did not like about this phone that would be it and that's searching really, really hard for something but other than that, my Samsung S3 and this Energy X Plus look the same. Now the other thing that worried me was the processor, ram, internal memory and all of the hardware. Let me break it down for you in simple terms without a lot of technical words. When I got this phone I proceeded to download in the course of 1 hour over 20 applications one after the other we're talking games, apps, music you name it I was downloading it all while browsing the web and opening other applications. I worried about lag and being slowed down, I have never had a phone perform so well under all that constant usage no lag, no skipping the phone performed beyond my wildest dreams it blew me away. So I was convinced the processor and ram have to be pretty good to keep up with all of my activities without lagging. Well I was happy with the hardware it was time to move onto the camera a feature I'm very hard on because I love taking photographs of everything. The camera like most phone has a rear 8MP camera with flash and auto focus along with a slew of other things to try out including a photo editor built in, the front facing camera is 5MP also with a flash. The quality of the pictures were comparable to most smartphones nowadays, they didn't seem off color, blurry or grainy what so ever. Moving onto the battery it's obvious main feature occupying the phone is a 4,000 mAh battery this is a massive size battery, but in respect to the device it's not a turtle shell it fits smoothly in the phone it does add weight to the phone, but it's still not a brick in your pocket. So realistically I've been using this phone since roughly 4 pm til now my time it's 5 am I'm still sitting at 34%. Now if that doesn't seem impressive enough this is what I've been doing on it non stop, streaming videos, playing games for hours, browsing the web, downloading music, reading, playing more games *high demand games*. This went on and on the phone screen did not shut off at all and when I checked before writing this the phone made me fully aware that it was not gonna shut down on me anytime soon by telling me it still had roughly 8 more hours of battery left, I was convinced this battery is the real deal. So here I was again impressed with a ""Budget"" phone. All aspects of this device blew me away and just left me in utter shock as to how a phone with a price tag under $500 or even $150 could preform like the rest of the competition and still not charge you an arm and a leg. In closing I just wanted to say that this phone is well worth your money if you need a phone that will out last your day, perform smoothly and look good doing it then this is definitely your device. Thanks for reading hope all your major questions are put to rest.",40

HTC One M8 - Factory Unlocked 32GB - US Warranty (Glacial Silver),HTC,138.99,4,"This just is a nice and proven phone. Originally I had bought the Blu studio 6.0 lte as the specs on that one are almost comparable. Hower that one ended up being a bad unit and was returned. Then I bought this. Love this phone. Although the screen is not 6 inches, it is big enough to work with.This review is being typed on the phone and the keyboard is easy to use.After set up, it will update to Lollipop. The thing which is mentioned not anywhere is that it requires a nano SIM card. So be prepared to get one of those.Ofcorse the m9 is bigger and better but also more expensive. Although this one is not cheap. It is a great phone with great specs. Clear screen, easy to use and great sound. Some people do not like the power button on top. I do like. The only dislike is the headphone pluggs in in the bottom next to the usb power.Enjoy it",0

Tried hard resetting the phone, upgrading the software to Android 6.0.1, but the problem could not be resolved.Contacted Sony support and after plugging in the IMEI their website says my phone was not under warranty, even though it was within a year of my purchase date from Amazon.Also had regular problems with SMS messages on this phone - messages received from people would periodically be in all Chinese characters (copied and pasted to Google Translate and the translation made absolutely no sense). I also had quite an unreliable time receiving MMS group text messages, with some responses not being received, or in the incorrect order. This is after consulting with the AT&T website and confirming that I had the correct APN settings entered.I tried the default Sony messaging app, Google Messenger, Google Hangouts, Textra, and other SMS/MMS apps, with no success.I have thrown in the towel on this phone, especially after the manufacturer refused to honor the 1-year warranty (as advertised in the product description).",0

"POSH MOBILE TITAN PRO HD ANDROID GSM UNLOCKED DUAL SIM 5.5"" HD SMARTPHONE EXTRA-large HD display, 13MP Camera and 8GB of Storage. 1 Year warranty. (Model#: E550 WHITE)",Posh Mobile,97.99,4,"I bought this with the intention of using it on WiFi for a while to decide if it would make a good phone. I still have not connected it with a cellular service, so I can't comment on call quality, but I do intend to. I was a little concerned about the screen size, the battery size and the amount of memory.The memory is workable if you remember to shut down apps that you aren't using. It's less tolerant of lots of apps running in the background than, some higher end devices like my Nexus 7, but with a little attention, it's not a problem.The battery, while small by today's standards, is adequate, given the small screen and modest processor power.The screen is decent. It doesn't like steep viewing angles, but despite its low resolution, still looks sharp, thanks to its small size. Speaking of size, the screen is legible and usable despite its size. It just displays less information at a time. it slows me down a bit, but it's a trade off for the small size of the phone.Cameras: not to be used for anything important, but they work for still shots and video.Bottom line- this is a cheap phone, so adjust expectations accordingly. That said, it is a capable phone which does the things you would expect a smartphone to do, with the added benefit of being very cheap, light and tiny.",0
"POSH MOBILE KICK ANDROID GSM UNLOCKED DUAL SIM 5.0"" SMARTPHONE with unique colorful design, FULL-sized display, 5MP Camera and 8GB of Storage. 1 Year warranty. (Model#: X511 BLACK)",,97.59,4,"I bought this product for a very particular purpose, to stream Pandora over WiFi at the gym. After searching for a WiFi capable MP3 or iPod, I realized there was no such thing. If there was, it was ridiculously expensive. Thinking outside the box I decided to purchase the smallest phone I could find, the POSH. It was difficult setting up the SIM card I bought from Walmart because of how small the buttons are, but it is surprisingly responsive. It does a great job for me at the gym with wireless earbuds linked (POSH is Bluetooth compatible). It is also a plus being able to make an emergency phone call whenever needed. The size comes in handy when you have little to no space. As an everyday phone, it may be a little too petite. Perhaps a young teenager may view it as quite the novelty. :) I hope this helps some of you in deciding. Thank you.",2

Turn out to be right out the box the sd card was format with xfat file system, so i have to reformat it to FAT32 than the phone was able to read the card afterward.I just wish BLU woud step up on the hardware little bit more like bump-up the ram to 2gb or so.

But Verizon told me that they don't have CDMA networks anymore. How can this be true, I have a Verizon phone and plan for 8 years now. Maybe its the region. Either way called net10 back and they asked for a 15 digit phone id # this time. I think that's why they told me I needed Verizon to unlock it, I only gave the 14 digit meid# the first time. Seems to be sufficient for my basic needs. So what did I learn?- for Net10 bring your own phone plan use the imei# on the phone box.- I can use their CDMA sim card in this phone in this region on Verizon towers, (buy the 4GLTE activation kit for $1.00, includes GSM & CDMA sim cards of all sizes).- Already have GSM sim card for if Verizon actually does stop using CDMA.",1

Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 i8160 Black Factory Unlocked 4GB 5MP Droid,Samsung,99.99,2,"I bought this phone about six weeks ago, the first 4 weeks it worked smoothly, I was very happy with my purchase and I thought I had found a great replacement for my old Iphone, but then, about two weeks ago, I felt asleep and I didn't charge my phone like I usually do. The next morning when I woke up the battery was dead, it wouldn't charge anymore and Im sure it was the battery because I have a friend with the same phone and I tried her battery in my phone and the phone worked. I left it connected to the power for about eight hours straight and nothing. I had to put the battery in a plastic bag and in the freezer for 10 minutes (an old trick I learned from my dad) and it worked. I haven't had any problems with the battery in these two weeks, but I'm scared it might happen again, I have to be very careful not to let the phone run out of power and carry the charger with me at all times.Then, about a week ago I started to have problems with the camera too. It says it has some sort of error. I have to shut down the phone, take the battery off and turn it on again in order for the camera to work (my friend, the one that has the same phone has the very same problem) This can happen once or twice a day and it gets REALLY ANNOYING!.I've read that the update to jellybean is coming soon. I really hope this is true and that these problems will be fixed with the new software. I live across seas and I can't afford to send it back or to exchange it.------------------------------------------------ESPAÑOL----------------------------------------------------------------------Compré este teléfono hace 6 semanas aproximadamente, las primeras 4 semanas funcionó de maravilla, pero hace como 2 semanas me quedé dormida y no lo puse a cargar como normalmente hago. En la mañana cuando me desperté la pila estaba muerta, no cargaba y el teléfono no prendía. Estoy segura que era un problema con la pila porque tengo una amiga que tiene el mismo teléfono y probé poner su pila en mi teléfono y funcionó. Lo dejé cargando como por 8 horas y nada. Al final, tuve que poner la batería en una bolsa plástica en el freezer y funcionó (un viejo truco que aprendí de mi papa). No he vuelto a tener problemas desde ese día, pero tengo que estar pendiente de que el celular no se descargue completamente de nuevo y llevar el cargador conmigo a donde quiera que vaya.Después de eso, hace como una semana, empecé a tener problemas con la cámara. Me sale un mensaje diciendo que hay un error. Tengo que apagar el celular, quitarle la batería y volverlo a prender para que funcione la cámara. A mi amiga, la que tiene el mismo teléfono, le pasa exactamente lo mismo. A veces esto puede pasar una o dos veces al día, y es un verdadero FASTIDIO.Leí por ahí que la actualización a jellybean viene pronto, de verdad espero que esto sea cierto y que con la actualización se corrijan estos errores. No vivo en Estados Unidos y no puedo pagar para devolverlo y no puedo cambiarlo en mi país porque la garantía no lo cubre.",17

I was looking for basically a phone that could do music, camera, and maybe even mini tablet and I am very pleased with it so far.I have mostly used the music player which comes out very crisp and can even be moved from an ipod with success. Since it is now pulling between MP3 files from my 32GB MicroSD card (a purchase I definitely recommend; the phone also takes MicroSDHC!) I do notice a stop when it moves from track to track when they are supposed to seamlessly blend into one another, but I don't find it too much of an issue. I love how the photos are much more crisp and I'm able to adjust for items such as brightness and focus more intuitively than on my phone or ipod.The phone does take AT&T SIM cards (the regular-sized or ""full"" version)and the voice quality is very good. I recommend using the speakerphone when you can (which comes out really well); but I moved from a basic clamshell phone so that's just me.",2

They are not application-hungry, and all their regularly required applications are there (WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr). Both love the People hub, and there is a pretty decent camera with excellent low-light performance. Since both of them have Windows 8 laptops, all they have to do is snap pictures and turn on their laptop when they get home. The pics are automatically synched via Skydrive via a setting, so no downloading and transfers or synchs. Last but certainly not least: the ability to have different colors of phones, plus the attention they garner because all the other kids have the same bland-looking smartphones with row of icons, and their Live Tiles really stand out in the group.Very satisfied with the purchase, and also with the fast delivery from FGS Trading and Amazon.",2

I decided to ignore it but now, 7 months after I got my phone, there's another issue: whenever the phone displays darker colors such as black, grey or dark blue, a bright blue spot appears in the upper middle of the screen. Also, the home and volume buttons have never felt quite right, there seems to be a little play to them. The phone has never been dropped or hit, neither has it got in contact with water.All these problems which appeared within the first year of use, the lower price offered by the seller (FGS Trading) compared to others (Amazon, for example) and the fact that the seller offers only a 30 day return policy add up to make me think the phone wasn't actually new when I bought it. It may have been a refurbished unit.Seller's post-sale service isn't particularly good either.",2

SPOT Global Phone - Lightweight Handheld Satellite Phone,,375,2,"This is basically a Globalstar phone with a Spot logo, billed through Spot on the Globalstar network. Spot was running a deal where they rebate you $250 on the $500 price. Not bad, but other vendors will give it to you for free with airtime plan:[...] The phone arrived on time but there is a prominent nick in the plastic on the face of the display. Not a showstopper but still irritating. The original UPC on the box was covered with a sticker that had apparently been applied by the dealer. Spot's rebate instructions clearly state the original UPC must be submitted so I have some concern I will ever see the rebate. If you are not familiar with a satellite phone you should be aware that quite a bit of open sky is required to get a signal, much more than is required for GPS or XM radio. But here's the kicker, reason I rated it so low: The phone has its outgoing caller ID blocked, so, for example, when I call my own home phone number, I get the message ""the party you have called does not accept calls from phones that have caller ID blocked"" and the call does not go through. I verified this ""feature"" with Spot customer service. They said they were aware of it and were working with the carrier (Globalstar) to get it removed, but could offer no timeline for when anything might happen. So here is a phone that would presumably be of use to reach out for help, search and rescue, etc., that is in ""Secret Agent"" mode and may very likely not connect with a number you may dearly want to reach. Ridiculous.",1

BLU PURE XL Smartphone - 4G LTE GSM Unlocked - 64GB +3GB RAM - Gold,BLU,134.95,4,"Review for BLU PURE XL SmartphoneArrived in 2 days using amazon prime. Boxed well and arrived intact.This is a good value smart phone that does 95% of what people will want and does it well. The 5% that may not be served well by this device are the hardcore users that truly make use of the CPU power regularly. If you are in the 5% then spend twice as much and get the Samsung note5 or some similar phone.Pro:Price = Good value based on specsSize = Wonderful, easy enough to hold and use. If I manage to get it in a shirt pocket it sticks out and looks funny.Screen = Wow, great definition. Netflix looks good. Almost too much resolution/dpi to appreciate at this size. Reviews show that this screen is not as bright as many devices at twice the price……they are correct but I still find it good for my needs. I have not tried to use it on a bright sunlit beach.Speed = Fairly quick. Fastest phone I have used. Rated at about 70% of the speed of the Samsung note5 at half the price.Battery recharge time: Fast with correct charger. 2hrs or less.Does all the things you would expect from a smart phone.Con:Size : If I manage to get it in a shirt pocket it sticks out and looks funny. I love the size but is hard to store. I put it in my back pack most of the time. Fits snuggly in my front pants pocket.Battery: ….. almost a deal breaker. If you use this as a phone primarily you should be ok, but if you use apps a lot then could be an issue. Here is my experience. Opened box, put phone on charger, arrives with 86% charge, charges to 100% in about 20 minutes or so. I start it up, install Google play account, download and install 2 items. One of them is a game that is cpu intensive…….I start it and let it run unattended for 1.5hrs. After 1.5hours the battery goes from 100% to 20%. I fully recharge it again and do the same test with similar results. I will keep my eye on this to see if subsequent recharges help it to hold a charge for longer. This has forced me to keep a charger with the phone as it needs recharging by noon. I recommend getting fast usb rechargers for work and home. The wall charger that comes with the phone is good, but I also have a usb battery charger….30000mah.CPU: Great bang for the buck, but it gets hot and runs the battery dead fast if you put this beast to its limits.Buttons along bottom: The back button is really hard to find. Sometimes it feels as if it is disabled as I slide my finger across the the whole bottom surface and nothing...then it starts working. This issue is the most annoying about this device....though the battery is a concern also.Over all I do not regret this purchase as I cannot afford what I want so I am happy with what I can get.",2

BLU PURE XL Smartphone - 4G LTE GSM Unlocked - 64GB +3GB RAM - Grey,BLU,129.99,5,"I've had nothing but good things from this phone and can't see why people say its to big or other problems. I can tell you this much this phone has more settings and advanced features then even a Samsung 7 does, I know this because I own both. Also funny how people say it's to big, but when you add a protective case to like the IPhone 7 plus then the 7 is far bigger? Reading, playing games, watching videos and doing everything is better, because you can see more on the screen at one time. Not only is all that better, but the camera is also Amazing, at 32MP with a nice zoom that really zooms , as with the phone itself the camera has advanced features for the novice or professional. Overall a great phone that can be tailored for whatever needs you have, so if you already own this phone I encourage you to play around with a the advanced features of this phone, it's well worth it. Oh and battery life is outstanding as well, but like any other phone if you don't have the battery saving turned on or you have a ton of apps open all the time then yes it will drain it fast.Note... Whenever you first get a new phone you want to let it drain all the way down before you charge it back up again, this will give a far better battery life, this also should be applied daily, so let it drain even to the point it shuts off, because this will give the battery a lot Longer life span. So many people will charge it half full and next thing they know the battery is shot .Also when you buy your phone make sure it is NEW and not used or a refurbished one, do a little digging as well to see if they have a good return policy and also check there feedback rating .",4

BLU Energy X LTE - 4000 mAh Super Battery - GSM Unlocked - Gold,BLU,124.99,3,"This is our third Android phone in about a year. This replaced a Blu Studio C that my wife had that stopped working. She never liked that phone, it replaced her iPhone 4GS. This model, the X LTE is much better than the Studio C and my Kata i3s IMO. Newest Version of android software, 5.1 and the build quality is just amazing at this price point. It's a very solid phone. She's had no problems with either reliability, software or reception. The battery life is just incredible. Also my wife is very hard on her phone, yesterday she accidentally dropped it right in front me from a height of about 4 feet, very hard landing, and it came out of that working fine. I actually think I'm going to replace my phone with this model. Excellent for the money. Comes with a hardback case and a screen protector. However my wife wanted the leather cover that has the magnetic tab on it seen in the accessories and that seems to be protecting it OK. Note, this is a GSM phone, so works with ATT, etc.UPDATE Its been a month and some of the initial luster is gone. My wife has had some problems with dropped calls, apps stop working, have to turn the phone off to end the call. This will be our last Blu phone.2nd UPDATE The new Moto 4g that just shipped blows this away. The Amazon ads and offer version of that phone is not much more than this phone and competes with flagship phones in performance. I wish it was available back when we bought this phone. The Moto 4g has twice the RAM, a much better processor, Marshmallow OS, 1080p, full 4G LTE compatibility and works with ALL U.S. Carriers.",25

Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty),Sony,499.99,4,"I purchased this phone about two weeks ago. This is my first android phone after switching from an iPhone 6. I've been pleasantly surprised by the phone so far. The andorid version on it seems decent and it works pretty well. The battery life is similar to my iPhone 6, with slightly better life when making phone calls and worse when doing a lot of data heavy tasks in facebook, twitter, google plus, email programs and browsing. It makes it easily through a day for me.Most of my issues so far have not been with the phone itself, but rather other services I want to use.For example, I haven't had any luck getting the AT&T visual voicemail app working with this phone. This was one of the few killer iOS features i miss and I feel like it should be built into android rather than apps for each phone company that suck and have a whitelist. This isn't sony's fault aside from their lack of a deal with any major carier in the US.The second issue is a lack of decent cases for the phone. Most of the ones on amazon so far have been cheap, soft cases that don't really hold up well. The screen protectors work as I had a drop the other day and it did take a chunk out of the protector but the phone is fine. I think I'm spoiled from owning an iphone for so many years, but a decent leather case would be much appreciated. Sony should offer some kind of case for it at least or make a deal for them.Finally, the text messaging app that is default with the phone isn't very good. This is easy to fix on android, but then I wasn't sure what to use. Many apps support it and I didn't see a feature matrix to know what to use. In this case, I think sony should consider a better default messaging app.The camera on the phone is decent, but I had hoped for a bit more. It's not as good in darker rooms as my iPhone was. It's also very bad when there is a lot of motion. For the price difference, this isn't a deal breaker for me but if you're really into photos this might not be the phone for you.A lot of people have asked me about the phone and commented on the appearance. Many people are impressed by the screen quality. I was as well. It's quite vivid.I do wish sony would fix their policy about not offering fingerprint scanning in the US. I miss that from my iphone.Another small headache was that contact imports were a problem. AT&T offered a tool to migrate and it was great for photos but only could grab 75 contacts. I had around 300. I ended up doing an export from icloud and then importing using google's contacts website. Most instructions online assume that you have a GMAIL account associated with google. In my case, I have a non google email account and it required finding this contacts site to actually work. The google site also cleaned up some duplicates from the AT&T import which was nice. Sony also has an app which I didn't try for contacts. It may have worked better. I'd recommend people just go right for the google site approach, especially if they don't need pictures imported.The location services are a bit buggy. I have it set to unlock my phone if it is at my house and it doesn't work sometimes. I don't know if that is an android issue or the phone GPS. The iphone was smart enough to realize if i was near my wifi i was home. I wish this phone understood that.Lastly, I had some issues with email. The stock app can connect to regular IMAP accounts fine. It works good for that. I also had a work GMAIL account with a custom domain and an exchange email account for grad school email. I didn't even try to use gmail from that app so I can't comment on that. I setup google gmail app. However, on my old iphone i had all but work mail setup in apple mail. With this phone, if i try to use exchange it tries to lock down the phone and won't allow any other email accounts to be setup. If I use microsoft outlook app, it works fine. I think this is a combination of a domain setup fail and the app. It shouldn't require those strict limitations on the email app if outlook works! This means I have 3 different mail programs to check 4 accounts. Kind of annoying.",6

Apple iPhone 5c 16GB (Yellow) - AT&T,Apple,248,2,"Admittedly, I was a rank amateur, but with a PhD in computer science, at researching iPhones and I was in a hurry, I had used Unlocked as my primary search key, and then honed the search down to this phone that included as the third point in the product listing, to the side of the maiin picture, a discussion of how unlocked phones were useful, blah, blah, blahSo I hit buy it now, and rush it to me, as I was preparing to leave for Europe. Much to my shock when I went to put the T-Mobile SIM card in it that would give me access to the new T-Mobile internationsl services, the phone rejected the SIM card, and the seller was rude about accusing me of making a mistake. And failed to ever admit that it was a glaring marketing bait-and-switch that his listing would come up when I marked Unlocked as my first level search key, AND the listing contained a discussion of the benefits of unlocked phones.Not wanting to be further abused by and obvious bully, I ceased discussion after I inquired about fast and inexpensive ways to save the wasted purchase for my European trip, and he was not well armed to handle that question, other than to warn against a significant number of fraudulent websites in that space.I still feel the listing was overly deceptive by not being screened by the primary search key, and for caring the collaborating discussion about the benefit of unlock phones, but more appalling was the seller's defensive and bullying attitude. Had he instead been eager to assist an inexperienced buyer to a quick solution, he would have won me over to telling my friends about him, but not in the way I tell them about him today.I was completely unsatisfied, but gave 2 stars to concede that had I had more experience and not been in such a hurry, I could have avoided ordering this product by mistake, by noticing the things he was immediately prepared to pointed out (because this had happened before??? then fix the way the listing is screened for major categories such as Unlocked) about the listings for the product I was actually after.",3
LG Nexus 5X Unlocked Smartphone - Mint 32GB (U.S. Warranty),LG,578,5,"I recently purchased an iPhone 6s Plus after having an iPhone 6 for nearly a year, and I just didn't like iOS anymore. I've been using iPhones since the iPhone 3GS days, and iOS doesn't really feel like it's changed. I have tried Android several times over the years, but decided to go 100% in this time. I purchased the Nexus 5X because I liked the smaller footprint, and I liked that it came straight from Google. The phone has been a fantastic upgrade so far. The OS is snappy, the device is well built, feels great in the hand, and is quite light. USB-C is great, and the fact that it's reversible is the best part. When I would use Android after using my iPhone, the biggest thing I missed was the reversible Lightning connector. The screen looks great as well, being very vibrant and bright. Touch screen responsiveness is also very precise, and the Nexus Imprint sensor is crazy fast. I thought the Touch ID sensor on my 6s Plus was fast, but this is even faster. I barely have to set my finger on the sensor for the phone to unlock. As a whole, the phone brings one of the best experiences available to the cell phone market (and at a low cost!) I have no problem recommending this device to anyone in the market for a new phone.",11

BLU Energy X Plus Smartphone - With 4000 mAh Super Battery- Global GSM Unlocked - Grey,BLU,139,4,"First off I bought this phone because I broke the screen on my prior phone. In searching for a replacement, I examined what I used my prior phone to do. I needed something to make calls on, texting and checking email on the go. Yup, thats it. While I previously spent more money for a phone that had blazing fast graphics, top of the line camera, etc. I found I rarely if even used those functions. In that regard this phone meet all my expectations. I could stop the review, but we add few extra details since I did ""downgrade"". The camera is horrible, focusing takes far to long rendering it virtually useless. (I took about 10 pictures in 1 1/2 years on prior phone so not a deal breaker) This phone only has 8GB ram, my prior phone had 32GB, I was surprised how quickly I ran out of space, but 64GB expansion card is only $15. Speaker phone is great, very loud, that being said so is the morning alarm if you forget to set the volume! Plays music and video without any problems, app management software must be well designed I've opened every app on the phone and experienced no hangups or slow downs. I do play one video game that does hangup a little, but still playable, if your looking for something for gaming you'll need to find another phone with more ram. Battery is awesome, streaming music from internet to my Jambox all day (9 hours) and still had 50% battery at end of the night. If the camera had performed better this would have been 5 star review. I deducted 1 star simply because manufactures description doesn't match my experience. Per below ""You deserve top notch picture quality and you will get just that with an 8 Megapixel main camera or the front 5 Megapixel selfie camera."" Camera under performs. I bought and paid for my phone and I'm offering you my unbiased review, hope it helps.***Couple weeks in and still happy with my purchase. I've still had no problems installing or using apps. Battery is gotten even better, I used to charge my Fire Phone at work mid day to prevent my phone from dying, but this phone can go two days with heavy usage no problem!",

LG Nexus 5X Unlocked Smartphone - Mint 32GB (U.S. Warranty),LG,578,3,"I don't love this phone for a couple of reasons which may not matter to others: 1) there is no user manual available - none came with it, none is available online, so while I am able to use it, I have no easy source to figure out a number of issues; 2) there is a known problem with the camera orientation, which is that some third-party apps, like my bank's mobile app, are not compatible with the orientation of the camera. This is a PITA when trying to take pictures of checks for deposit. The solution suggested on number forums is for us - the users - to contact the developers of the third party apps and scold them for not updating the apps to keep up with this and perhaps other phone cameras.

(read update for damage)Has a port for charging and mini-SD cardThe sim card slot started causing problems after a month in, so I took some receipts/paper and folded it between my battery and the cover, snug tight, and all is well.Touchscreen/SoftwareTouchscreen is not scratch resistant, so that's too bad. You can use about anything to touch, but be careful. I got pen marks all over mine.It's a little hard to press with your fingers unless you have nails like a girl or use a stylus (or pencil)It's like most touchscreens, not oilproofYou can change the brightness (to save battery or whatnot, which btw, will make it hard to see in the sunlight)I would give it 4 stars since it's a new thing/idea/innovative (3 if it wasn't innovative), but it's also dirt cheap compared to the upcoming ones (don't ask me how I know), so I gave it 5 instead.FYI, I likey.*******Update 11/28/13Damage: The band broke a month or 2 ago because the connection with the watch is weak. I superglue'd it back, but it's not something I should have to deal with.USAGE: It has a calculator, FM radio (plug in the headset that it comes with), HORRIBLE camera, bluetooth capability, and anything else you would want in a phone (besides the apps and stuff like that).The box includes:charger usbusb to outlet converter (the best I have ever seen in my life). Works for any usb and is invincible!earphones that work as your antennae for the radioWatchExtra batterySure, you may see Andriod or Apple watches that look amazing, but this one IS A PHONE. Those only connect to your phone.",2

I'm a long-time Windows Phone user and just made the switch back to Android as Windows Phone is finally losing its steam and becoming less viable. I originally switched from Android five years ago because of ugly UI and excessive bugs. No more! This OS is beautiful and I haven't encountered a bug yet! It's also swayed at least one of my iPhone friends to switch back to Android. My only two gripes are that the phone defaults to Korean (must press a different button in setup to switch) and displays a lot of unnecessary notifications, but both of these are easy to remedy.If you're curious about how to set this up on your mobile carrier, I'd urge you to read up on it online, but it was very simple for me. I'm on T-Mobile, and I just popped the SIM card out of my old phone and put it into this one. Done. No set up with the carrier over the phone, no online activation--I was able to start using it immediately. The only real catch is to make sure the SIM card in your current phone is supported by this one. I think there are three different kinds of SIM cards. The ZenFone 3 has slots for two of them, so chances are you'll be alright--just check first.",1

"ASUS ZenFone 2 Laser Unlocked Smartphone, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage",ASUS Computers,229,1,"I posted my previous review too quick. There are issues with this phone. I bought mine 3/27/2016 and now I have a ""brick"". Originally, the phone worked ok but the touchscreen was very insensitive to touch. About 1.5 months of use, I put the phone on the charger at bedtime, next morning it would not power on. As this is an unlocked phone, I assumed it was the OS. After reviewing many forums and calling Asus, I decided to ""root"" the phone. This remedied the problem with the touchscreen and I actually got the Marshmallow OS on and was loving it. I was so happy my phone was working. After maybe a month, I noticed that the battery life wouldn't get me through a day before completely going dead. Today, after a full charge, it won't turn on. When I push the power button, it vibrates and flashes the ASUS startup splash, reboots with the same process until I take the battery out. I noticed that the battery drains down to about 85% during this symptom, so I am thinking that the battery is bad. I will see if a replacement helps.

At first I just used the basics of email, web surfing, and navigator but as time goes by I am amazed at what this phone can do. Most of the time I stumble on to its abilities by doing something else - of course you can download the manual which would probably explain it functions faster; but discovery is half the fun.I have never owned an Apple product because of the price (after all it is just a phone); but I'm wondering if they could make a phone this good for the same price - AND unlocked so you can choose your own carrier.I don't recommend many products but this one definitely gets a thumbs up!February 1, 2014 UpdateWill only connect to the internet if you are using Wi-Fi.This really is a great phone for the price but I have to knock off one star for the fact that it will not connect to the internet unless you are using Wi-Fi.

Nokia N9 16GB 3G Wifi GPS NFC GSM Unlocked MeeGo Touchscreen (Black),Nokia,NA,5,"This phone is something special...extraordinary, even. I've owned or seen many wonderfully designed products (Apple's included) but the N9 exists on a whole different plane of beauty and elegance. I didn't buy it for the functionality (apps are everything for smartphones, and only Apple's iOS or Android win here), I bought it for its design.Unlike every other phone on the market (save Nokia's own Lumia phones), this thing exists and feels as one piece. It is carved out of a single polycarbonate (plastic) block, and the entire front face of the phone is the screen, covered by a sheet of Corning Gorilla glass that curves down slightly towards the edges, so that it sits flush with the phone's body. There's not a single hard edge anywhere, no small crevices, no screws. Nothing else out there feels as exquisite in the hand!And the screen is the second most important thing. Yes, it's not as dense pixel-wise as Apple's iPhone 4 (300 pixels per inch). But it comes quite close, at 256 ppi, which is still far higher than any television or computer screen out there. And the color and contrast! If you've ever looked at some of Samsung's high-end Android phones or tablets, you've seen the amazing color vibrancy and punch of their screens. Well this phone uses the same technology, and the colors pop, and the black is truly black. It is stunning, and I prefer it over the screens that Apple uses.Third, the OS. It's every bit as intuitive as Apple's, and I believe it improves upon it in many ways. There's only one gesture you really have to learn besides tapping, and that's swiping. There's no physical or virtual home button, and no little tray of icons at the bottom of the screen. It's just a grid of colorful icons that you scroll through vertically. To find or change to any apps you currently have open, you simply swipe to the right, and you see them all in card view. To get back, just swipe to the left. Nokia has their own font they've designed, and I like it better than any other font I've seen designed for the screen.Another crucial factor with smartphones is battery life. I don't use my N9 real intensely (like listening to a lot of music, or watching movies) and I'd say I average a little more than a day's worth of use per full charge. I use mine on AT&T's network and I've had no problems whatsoever. Gmail works great with the mail app. Browsing the web is a smooth, pleasant experience. I've put my own pictures, music, and documents on it from my iBook G4 over USB, without any extra software. It takes good pictures, but struggles in low-light. The keyboard is also an important factor, and this one is great. I tend not to like typing on the small onscreen keyboards all smartphones have, but this one is bearable, almost enjoyable. With the recent Meego update, a Swipe keyboard is also included. There are social apps included (Facebook, Twitter) but I don't really use them (though, from the once I've used it, the Facebook app is quite attractive.)For those like myself, who truly appreciate superb design, flawless execution, and impeccable build quality, the Nokia N9 will surpass your expectations!",15

After 3 or 4 days you completely forget these things though mostly because the phone is buttery smooth and the Amoled display is so much better than LCD at displaying colors and brightness. The phone handles everything I throw at it without a hiccup. I mean it is smooth. It just feels so efficient and well optimized. The battery life will probably send this phone into the realms of android lore for a long time. Using it full blast it stills last ALL freaking day, absolutely amazing.It's almost pure android and this was a big issue for me. LG offers a ton customization which stock android doesn't . I still can't believe that you can't customize the Nav bar soft buttons, really google? I ended using a gesture program to get around this. I really wish the camera was better. It would have made this phone a true monster. As it is, it's still an amazing piece of hardware. It goes to show that sometimes taking a step back, lower resolution, slower processor can lead to a better experience.",2

Samsung Galaxy Note 5 N920C 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM - White,Samsung,599,5,"I love almost everything about this phone.Fast, functional, lots of apps, and they WORK. Crisp screen, beautiful colors. A camera that can easily compete with most stand-alone digital cameras and beat the vast majority of the phone cameras out there. Excellent shutter speed (very important!). For me, it was the perfect time to switch. I hear that cameras were quite good on iPhones for a while, but I wouldn't touch an iPhone with my foot - stupid iTunes that will reorganize, rename and erase your files on its own, no direct connectivity with the computer... Forget it.I wouldn't have been happy with a lesser camera, I've had enough of blurry blotchiness - thank you very much! Samsung's cameras just recently gotten really good, from what I understand (I might be wrong here; I didn't spend a lot of time researching the issue of camera quality on older models).As an ex-Blackberry user, I do miss the full wired keyboard, but oh well, you can't have it all, I guess. Pros of this phone outweigh the cons by far. I tried the keyboard case/cover, and I think I could make it work. The problem of the keyboard is that it does not fully adhere around the edges, so the key strokes on the sides of it do not register well (or not at all). With a couple of brackets that would keep it perfectly flat against the screen, it could be perfected. I returned the keyboard for now. When I'm ready and have an easy, elegant snap-on solution in mind, I might purchase it again, just not in blue (too dark).Another con - the absense of a memory card slot, and non-removable battery. I hope that Samsung will bring these features back in the future models. We don't need another sealed-from-the-world i-effing-Phone. Who wants all this extra security can go to the apples. I am definitely in the let-us-do-what-we-want camp.All this said, the phone is 99% perfect. Maps, e-mail, camera, Skype, youtube, great calendars, you name it... I'm done dragging my laptop behind on trips, this phone has it all....It also appears that some sort of ""wireless conflict"" took place in our house when this phone came in and joined the wireless crowd. We have 2 laptops and they were both connected via wifi. We noticed that streaming video started ""hickupping"" a lot even at lower resolutions, and sometimes was totaly unwatchable (we don't have cable, and stream news, some youtube, movies). That shouldn't be happening with 25 megabit per second connection, divided by 2,5 (half being the phone), even taking into account the wireless losses. So I poked some holes in the walls, ran ethernet cables for the computers, and disabled their wifi. That seems to have cured the problem. Go figure. Now we have 2 happy internet-wired comps and one happy phone, the wifi monopolist.Highly recommend this gadjet. It is plain COOL.",1

Haven't tried it in water so I can't rate that feature. Now getting used to the smaller size after having the T2 for a while. Comparable to that the battery in this phone is awfullllllll.

Moto Z Play + Insta Share Projector,,723.87,4,"Excellent phone for the money. If battery life is what you are looking for this is the phone you should buy. I can get two days of battery life. Sometimes into a third day. I average about 8:30 hours of screen on time but There have been times when I've gotten 10 hours. The battery life on this device is simply amazing.Don't be dissuaded by the Snapdragon 625 processor. This phone has NO LAG. It is one of the snappiest phones I've used. Unless you plan on using this phone primarily for hardcore gaming the processor won't be an issue for you at all. Even if you do want to game a lot it's not like you won't be able to but your frame rates and loading times will be a little slower than with a phone with a higher end processor.The display is beautiful. It's only 1080p and not 2K like a lot of flag ships but it is a gorgeous 1080p screen. My past 2 phones had 2k screens and this screen does not feel like a downgrade. In normal day to day use you won't be able to tell the difference.....AND....that 1080p screen is part of the reason the battery life is so good.The Motorola specific features(Moto Voice, Moto Display, Moto Actions etc) are nice and hard to live without once you get used to them.There are a few slight cons with this phone but none of them are deal breakers. It is a little unnecessarily large in my opinion. The bezels are a little large on all sides. The camera is acceptable but not great at all. The Motomods feel like an unnecessary gimmick to me. I have the speaker and it is nice but you can get better sound and more volume from $20 bluetooth speakers. The style shell mods are nice but I wish there were more options. You don't really need any of the battery mods because the battery life is already class leading. The projector is overpriced for what you are getting. The camera mod is not very good. Also The mods are a little more lose when attached to the Moto Z Play than when attached to the regular Moto Z or Moto Z force. I suspect the Z and Force have magnets on the bottom and top of the phone while the Z Play only has magnets on the bottom of the phone.All in all this is a great phone. Hard to beat for the money.",8

"Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679",Samsung,119.99,2,"I only had it for less than a week, but I'm really digging this phone. It's my first smart phone, so I'm not speaking with tons of experience.There is a bunch of bloatware on this phone. I installed the ZergRush root:(...)And then Titanium Back-up app which allows backing-up to the SD card and removal of all the crap.Worked great. Still exploring all the capabilities this phone has.The voice recognition seems to work really well. I've used it a few times with the Google search function when I didn't feel like typing.It has locked-up once while surfing the web which required a battery pull. Re-booted with no ill-effects.A primary attraction to this phone was the availability of T-mobile's $30/mo 100 min/unlimited text and data plan. I wanted a smart phone on a monthly plan, but not the typical $70/mo charge you've got with a contract. For me, this is an ideal package as I'm not a big talker.That being said, read the fine print. This plan is only available via Walmart and T-mobile.com. The catch is that going through either of these sources makes it difficult or impossible to port your old number.To activate my phone, I called T-mobile's porting resolution number at 877-789-3106. They activated my phone and ported my old number, but then despite my request, set me up with the $50/mo unlimited plan. I had to call customer service and do some arm twisting to get on the ""Walmart plan"".In hindsight, it may have been easier to have paid an extra 10 bucks and bought the phone from Walmart.8/8/2012 UPDATE:This sucker runs HOT. Gets pretty warm while websurfing and streaming. Gets scalding hot while running Navigation. It's locked up a few times while running navigation. Pretty much the worst time to have to shut down and restart your phone (while driving).This last time when trying to restart, I got a message stating the battery was too hot, or something to that effect. I've started removing the case when using the Navigation.I'm pretty sure these symptoms are leading up to premature battery failure. Time will tell. Might try a different case to alleviate the issue.Other than that, I'm really happy with the phone.7/22/14 UPDATE:Final update. I dumped this phone about 6 months ago. It began to crash, restart and just plain shut down indiscriminately. Part of the problem may have been the SD card, it just didn't have the processing power to handle anything but the simplest apps. Biggest offender might be the latest Facebook updates. Any GPS app also will freeze it up instantly. My wife still has her phone of the same model, and we're getting ready to dump it too for the same issues.This model it just plain obsolete in 2014, and I would not recommend purchasing one at any price. It worked marginally well for the first six months, but after that, it became a turd.The good news is my new Moto X works awesome and I was able to seamlessly transfer my $30/mo 4G plan.",2

Although it's worth every bit of the asking price on Amazon.,0

Rugged Cell Phone GSM 3G Unlocked Waterproof Shockproof IP68 Certified Military Grade Camera Flash Light Bluetooth FM Radio USA Worldwide Dual Sim - Black,Plum,69.99,1,"I got this phone to replace my MANN ZUG S, which I loved but was only 2G. My network, AT&T is switching off 2G in a few months.YaysFirst, the plus, since there really is only one: It is 3G. I now have reception where I didn't before (like at work) and better call reception elsewhere. And I can use a headset with this phone, which I could not do with my MANN. (I guess that's two.)BoosNow, the negatives. First, the buttons on this phone are terrible. They do not make contact with the connector cells well. You can push the same button five times before it does anything. Sometimes, it will beep like you've pushed it but still not do anything. Other times, you can hit the button once and it goes through 3 steps on the phone. I have been using this phone one week and have already accidentally sent texts I was trying to delete. The buttons are also very small and there's a lot of extraneous pre-set buttons that so far I have had no need to use.Cannot get photos off phone without removing battery pack and micro SD chip. I feel like this HAS to be incorrect, but it is what the instructions say, and, as far as I can tell, true. When I hook the phone to my PC via USB cable, I'm given an option on the phone to treat it like a mass storage device. This is how my MANN connected to PC. However, whether I choose that option or any of the other options, the phone never shows up in the file manager and I cannot access anything stored on it.No mms, no picture texts. I don't really mind this since my MANN couldn't do that either, but I recognize it's still an issue for most people.It really does need to use the charger that comes with it. Although the port is standard micro-USB, it is buried so far into the phone that you need to use the cord that comes with the phone. The micro-USB end seems to be slightly longer than standard. When I have attempted to use another micro-USB charger, I could not get the plug to stay in the phone.The screen options all seem to be designed with coordinated instead of contrast colors. This means that in many cases, such as when looking at the list of text messages, missed calls, etc., you cannot read most of what is on the screen and cannot tell which item is highlighted. This is particularly bad in sunlight.I have not yet tested the durability or water-proof claims.Eh-factorsOthers have mentioned problems with the flashlight turning on while in their pocket or purse. My flashlight cannot be turned on until the phone is unlocked, so I have not had this problem.It is really light, at least compared to my work iPhone and my MANN phone, but there's such a trade-off in usefulness that it hardly matters.",3

CAT PHONES S60 Rugged Waterproof Smartphone with integrated FLIR camera,CAT PHONES,592.5,4,"I've been using this phone for a little bit now so have a decent understanding of its capabilities versus my previous Nexus 4 phone. It's an unlocked GSM android phone; Verizon and Sprint won't work on this phone but GSM carriers such as T-Mobile and AT&T will work. Who knows if they'll release a CDMA version in the future but you shouldn't buy this if you can't use it. Not a problem with the phone just a requirement given its specs.That said the phone is pretty cool. I've used the thermal capabilities and have tried out the waterproofness of it. I haven't tried dropping it but I broke a phone in the past doing that so even if it can handle it I won't be doing that test on purpose. There are some youtube videos of people seeing how far they can take it though and from what I saw it wasn't until they smashed it on the ground as hard as they could that the glass cracked. Pretty cool.The waterproof feature is neat. You should immediately turn off the screen prior to putting it in the water as the water seems to sometimes act like a touch on my screen and click whatever I had opened. Not terrible but random in a sense so good to just lock it. I tried playing a video under the water and it worked but the speakers become inaudible once it's underwater as one would expect. As soon as it comes up from the water the phone detects such as it'll ask you if you'd like to run the speaker clean program. It makes a lot of really loud noises for a few minutes to clear it out.The phone does concern me at times with the waterproofing due to the back SIM card door being pretty easy to open by touching the switch there with a little pressure. I'm fine with it but seeing that made me second guess letting my son ever touch it near the water. To charge the phone you open up a waterproof compartment to the side which shows the USB charging outlet. If that were to open underwater it could also kill the phone but the door stays pretty shut when it's shut. It's actually kind of a pain to open at night to charge but I'm getting better at feeling it out in the dark.The thermal imaging is cool because it lets you overlay the photo with the thermal data in realtime via the FLIR app. It lets you see exactly where the heat is generating from. At first mine was off a lot with the overlay but there's a calibration setting in the FLIR settings that lets you change how it lays on top to make it match. Mine is still a little bit off but works for the most part. I found the automatic feature there to not work though as it made it worse than my manual adjusting of the overlay. It seems pretty good for what it is. The other FLIR app you can download is also cool because you can add/remove pins which let you see the temp at that location, can change the thermal coloring on the fly after the fact, etc. Unfortunately the phone doesn't register as a FLIR device in that app but it's easy to open directly from the included FLIR app to the editing so it's not terrible just can't use all those features. I'll attach some thermal shots of my dogs.It's a nice phone and it works for what you need. It's taking me a bit to get used to the hard buttons at the bottom because I'm used to touching on screen ones but they work well enough. Only downside is at night they don't backlight up so you have to keep in mind to touch tell where it is and press it as needed. Not terrible but again a little backlight there would have been useful as these are core buttons used by ever app.In general I'd suggest this phone to anyone who does not need all the bells and whistles of a gaming or photography phone but wants a rugged phone that works well and can handle environments where you phone may otherwise be in trouble. The thermal feature likely will not be used too often by normal users but anyone who would do home inspections, construction, etc. will likely find it to be a godsend. I love being able to see where heat is escaping in my home. It's just really cool and I'm likely to be asked by friends to bring my phone over their places as they hear about it.Don't buy this because you want the thermal alone as you could always buy a FLIR add-on to an existing phone. Buy this because you think you need a phone that can handle whatever you throw at it. It's a phone for people with things to do.",6

I love the fact that I just swapped my Sim card from my old phone into the Blu phone and chaged my APN setting to NET10 which was already programmed into the phone!! YES!! There are at least 4 other companies pre-programed. This phone plays Netflix with No issues. The Sound of calls are very loud and clear to hear though the speaker phone unlike the Cubot P9. The screen is very nice and responsive. The phone moves quickly. overall as of now this is the Best Cheap phone money can buy And I've bought alot of cheap phones!! hopefully this will be my last.

I wanted a full-featured upgrade but didn't want a giant phone. The Z1 slips easily into my jeans, it's very fast, waterproof, has an excellent camera and an FM stereo radio for running. Call quality seems fine so far, although I tend to text more than call. I don't store a lot of media other than photos, but I if do in the future I can add a big SD card to hold it. It looks good, but was a bit slippery uncased. I added a clear Ringke Fusion case that solved the problem. Still looks good. For my purposes, it beats the i6 pretty much across the board.

"Apple iPhone 6, Silver, 128 GB (Verizon)",Apple,399,5,"I really love this phone ,though it was going t be too big but not really that bad.I had been using 4s and really liked how I could fit it into a fron pocket ,but after waiting too long decided to go with this size iPhone and try it out.Battery life is excellent and the bigger screen is worth carrying around the size.So here s so helpful information (I bought a used one ),the phone is unlocked as a modelA1549 ,no matter if the person who brought it from Verizon leased or bought it out right.That is just how Verizon does it ,there is only one USA model A1549 ,I am not sure if a GSM seller such as t-mobile just deactivated the CDMA capabities or the firmware doesn't have them.So I knew this and bought it to use on T-mobile (actually this is better that a GSM only phone because you can sell it to anyone once you are done with it),the Hotspot feature and WiFi calling both work ,just search wifi calling after you put in your SIM card .Then the first time you use the phone it will ask you to confirm your 911 address ,then you just turn it on and off .Okay now to the great part ,I took a chance on Warehouse deals and it paid off.If you look at a phone for sale by AWD,you will notice just a condition is given (all description as other warehouse deals).The lowest deal ""acceptable ""means this for sure no original box ,no charger and no earbuds.The ""good ""means maybe one of those things is included but not all.The ""very good ""means everything but original box and condition must match (signs of wear but no dents,not many marks or scratches) and like new means just that looks new with everything original.Now if you go for the lowest condition as I did ,you can receive a ""like new looking phone"" with nothing else or a slightly beat up one with scratches on glass.And you can receive any condition in between just no extras.When I ordered the phone ,it stated that it would take a while to get it (AWD doesn't always have the phone ready ,just one matching the description from whoever they bought it from),so basically they uses the lowest ""acceptable "" as a hedge against someone complaining.The phone I got was completely ""like new"" and they threw in a plastic bag with charger and earbuds,and the price was cheaper that any other seller on here by quite a bit also.Take a chance on AWD ,if you are unhappy you can return ,plus they have the best customer service.",1

Don't buy those iPhones that are unlocked by software, because you can't update iOS.My existing T-Mobile contract doesn't have a data plan. All I had to do was disabling 3G and Data from Settings > General > Cellular. After that Wi-Fi works fine and I don't have to pay for a data plan.Note that if you do a factory reset on the phone, the only way to get through the initial setup is either by having a data plan or activate via USB cable attached to a computer having iTune installed.The condition of the phone is dependent on who you buy it from.

BLU Life 8 XL Smartphone - Unlocked - Global GSM - White,BLU,125.99,3,"Received the phone after waiting 2 weeks when it was released was and SUPER excited after it was on sale for 85 bucks! I had to buy it! There is a lot to talk about lol The phone has 2 SIM cards, Slot 1 is for 4G and 3G signal while Slot 2 is 2G next to the battery which you must removed to access. Dont forget the SD card slot. Battery life is great it lasts me to the end of the day just from texts, videos and web. The screen is awesome 5.5 inches, 720p goodness! I have big hands and it is still hard for my thumb to reach to the corner of the screen, capacitive buttons to squeeze out more size I would assume. Volume buttons and the power button are located on the right side of the device, headphone jack on top and charger port on the bottom. Weight on the phone is okay though it is not balanced very well, there have been times where ive had the phone go over my index finger. (Big hands) The camera is okay 8MP with a LED light to accompany it. Front camera is 2MP which I dont really care for unless youre a selfie person or for skype for pictures youll be using those filters to help the image quality lol. The back speaker is a bit too loud in my opinion. Great phone for the price! Bloat-free, I have rooted the device with Kingo Root. Now the bad stuff oh boy..BAD!1. The smartphone did not attempt to read my 32G SD card, Ive tried MANY cards on the device and nothing. I asked for a replacement for the dead SD slot which came in to days woo! Grabbed the new replacement aaaaaand IT DID NOT WORK! Really frustrating since I have tons of music on those cards.2. On both devices Ive had the same problem. The battery seems to be picky about what phone charger can and CANT charge it! What the...3. While charging, the top half of the huge screen becomes unresponsive! Bringing down the notification bar at the home screen is almost impossible while charging. (Maybe its the voltage coming into the device??)4.So MANY bugs on the UI, such as the swipe lock screen. I touch the bubble swipe to the right and the it unlocks and locks immediately! to access my home screen I must go through my notifications bar and menus menus menus. Another example, the dial pad, dialing numbers lags really bad.5. Im not sure if it is specific apps (YouTube etc.) or the wifi hardware, but while watching 720p videos they seem to buffer too often. Making HD videos almost unwatchable. It could be the 4.4.2 KitKat OS that is contributing to 95% of these problems and hopefully they will be fixed with the 5.0 Lollipop upgrade which the ETA on that is unknown. Otherwise its a GOOD starting phone with decent specs but if problems continue to arise I might will return this phone and spend 75 bucks more for a better upgrade. I could bump to 4 stars if 5.0 Lollipop comes in.",12

The Google Play Store, lets you download plenty of apps that are compatible with this device.However it is a 4G phone, and my SIM is capable of LTE meaning I am not used to the slowness of the data. If you're connected to Wifi there shouldn't be a problem, and if you're used to 4G data then then you should be okay.It has a 2 mega pixel main camera and a VGA front camera, and if you came here for a good camera... Well probably not the best place to look. The main camera typically gets the job done however.With 4GB of internal memory, adding an SD card is a good idea especially if you love music and lots of apps. I haven't used very much of the data so I don't have many complaints.The charger is mini USB but the metal part of the charger that connects to the phone is a tad longer than your average USB so don't break it or lose it.Overall it's a very good media player and I don't regret purchasing it.

I find typing with the keyboard much easier. I always had trouble using the keyboard on my galaxy s3, even with different keyboards. the iPhone is not as customizable as android but I can live with that. so far, the battery has lasted over 2 days and is still at 32%. this is since I activated it 2 days ago.True, I am still setting it up but I will manually sync my iPhone with iTunes. my android phone was driving me nuts, always updating several times a day from google play. my battery lasted around 1 1/2 to 2 days. if the iPhone is similar, I will be happy. all in all I am very pleased with my new, pre owned iPhone 5s. buying from amazon warehouse or fulfilled by amazon is the way to go!",10

I returned it the same day! It doesn't look like in pictures, the color is off white and is not shiny but very dull looking. The slider is wobbly and loose so it doesn't feel good in the hand. I've always thought Nokia products were well made but this phone just felt cheap. I had the Nokia C3 before and even it feels higher quality.The Symbian OS is nothing to boast about but i knew that, however the touchscreen is quite annoying because you have to double tap to select something, if you tap once a ""tip"" pops up instead. It's okay for the price, but there are better phones that cost the same or just a little more like the Samsung Wave 533 or the LG GW620.",6

I am using over T-Mobile network and there are no issues. I read a review saying someone had issues with Wi-Fi connection, I can say it is working fine with me.To make it clear let me tell you my usage style.I am using my phone as a phone first and that is most important. No issues with that so far, than emails, web, Skype, video apps remote desktop.Everything works great. I do not play games on my phone so I cannot say anything about that. I register the phone for building windows phone apps and even I ran own apps on the phone, very nice.Also I am planning to use the second sim soon and then I will update my review.Bottom line is a great phone for my needs and running great so far.The reason I gave 4* is because of the rear camera. Quality is good but not great.",17

The first thing you need to do as with any computer device is to update the firmware by going to the Nokia site. Once this is done, it worked perfectly. I have easily set-up my personal POP e-mail on this unlocked device. The WI-fi works great on my home wireless and WI-fi hot spots. I have already downloaded many free apps to tweak it to my liking. It allows me to delete the crap I don't use. I am done, buying locked phones from cell carriers. You have little to no control over the phones installed apps. This phone works great on my cheap pay as you go non-contract plan. Plus I got it a little cheaper since somebody sent one back. Most likely because, they didn't take the time to updatefirmware to the latest version.",1
Glocalme G1S Global Unlocked Mobile Wi-Fi Hotspot Roaming-Free SIM-Free Support Over 108 Countries with 2GB Initial Global Data Equals 60EUR,Glocalme®,98.99,4,"Good for travel with family, everyone can share the wifi spot. The reason I gave it 4 stars is the item I received didn't include the ""60 euro refill card give away in the box"" as it's clearly described on AMAZON, instead, it came with 2G data (365 days). I want to use the refill card to recharge the wifi machine then use the credit to buy the suitable data package for specific travel destination as I want, Since I already have promotional data package purchased on their site weeks ago for upcoming Asia travel, I called GlocalMe to see if they will activate my purchased Asia data package first (it's cheap but validate for 30 days) instead of using the 2G global data first. The answer I got from the service desk is ""NO"", I was told I must use the included 2G data first. So what I realize the company will not get 60 euro refill card as they said, what you really get is 2G data, and you must use it all first even if you find a promotional data package on their website. I was disappointed over the deal and service, but still give it a 4-star to encourage the effort of making this useful gadget for traveler.",1

It seems as I played with it that it didnt drain if I didnt use it, but when I did use it, even just for small things it drained quickly. Its sad really because it felt great, reacted great, nice screen size, but I didnt get into much more since I got caught up in trying to stop battery drain. I did a factory reset twice just in case the update did not load correctly but nothing changed. Nice looking phone, but a cell phone is useless if you have to treat it like a corded wall phone. :(",2

Battery life is fabulous - I only charge up about once a week or less.Cons would include the following: the number buttons are small, so dialing a number is hard to do without looking closely at the phone. I'm not that bothered by that because I tend to call the same people again and again, who are saved as contacts. The web browsing is a joke. You have to float the arrow around with the up/down keys.

"Samsung Captivate, Black 16GB (AT&T)",Samsung,589.99,5,"I'll keep this review short and sweet, as there are a lot of other reviews with the pros and cons. I had Verizon's Droid Eris before this and the phone had only a 524mhz processor and to my surprise the Verizon network sucks where I live. The phone was slow, typing on the virtual keypad was horrible as it would lag and stutter, and everything about the phone was slow. This phone with a 1000mhz processor is super fast, I don't have to worry about killing apps, and the keyboard is fantastic!! Absolutely no lag and the screen is just gorgeous. Call quality has been great and I get great service where I am in AT&T.I wanted to get the Epic for Sprint because of the physical keyboard, but after using the captivate I really don't need the physical keypad. This thing JUST WORKS.(9/14/10)Edit: The GPS is broken currently, but it is a software issue so it is apparently being fixed. Also, when I received the phone I had problems with it randomly turning itself off. I returned the phone to Amazon and got a new one. So far, no problems with the new phone. I did a lot of research on this issue and it appears to be a bad batch of Captivates and not a software issue or an app issue.",4

The display is beautiful even compared to the super amoled displays on other phones. They are both gorgeous in their own ways, and the 6+ is still very bright, colorful, and crisp.

Whenever someone sees it they frequently say how nice it looks or inquire about the name and company.While this is a good phone for the price, there are some qualms I have about it. While visually nice looking, this is not a higher quality phone. When the pictures taken with this phone are transferred to another phone it loses its pixels quality. For instance, if you take a picture with Huawei and look at it in the picture gallery of the Huawei, the picture looks great. However, when you take the same picture and send it via email or bluetooth or text to a different device the picture looks grainy and undeveloped.There is a lag with the internet and also the phone is somewhat slow to turn on.Truthfully, I would not buy the phone again as I have had better name brand (Samsung, Sony, LG) at just 50 dollars or 100 dollars more.Edited 3/2/2016: This phone does not mute outside noise or interference.

It looked good and the physical keyboard was very useful. Unfortunately the phone (OS) crashed very often what became extremely annoying. After the OS crash you have to remove the battery and restart the system. Once I overslept and was late to work just because the system froze in the night and the alarm didn't ring in the morning.What is really unbelievable is the fact there is no firmware update available for this model. It just shows how much LG cares about the functionality and reliability of their devices and customers' satisfaction. I dumped this phone and got myself a cool new Android handset which most importantly just works. I'm very disappointed with LG and will stay away from their products. I sincerely advise you the same.,2

If you are a creative and artistic producer, director, photographer even screenwriters, this phablet (phone/tablet) is definitely for you. Some Key Features are:• Quad-band GSM and quad-band 3G with 21 Mbps HSDPA and 5.76 Mbps HSUPA supportThe international version comes with 3G but NOT LTE keep this in mind if you want some LTE speed.• 5.5"" 16M-color Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen of HD (720 x 1280 pixel) resolutionThe screen is vibrant and vivid, and in the setting you can either change it for normal or movie, under normal preset you’ll get a lot more battery life though.• Android OS v4.1 with TouchWiz launcherOf course the android version at the time of release was Jelly Bean 4.1, but Samsung is already prepping an upgrade to 4.2.2, when you first connect your phone to kies or a wireless router you be prompted to update, this will take you to version 4.1.2 for the time being.• 1.6 GHz quad-core Cortex-A9 CPU, Mali-400MP GPU, 2GB of RAM, Exynos 4412 Quad chipsetCurrently one of the fastest CPU’s around, I noticed no glitches or crashes for the 2 months test period I ran the Note II trough. The TouchWiz of Samsung runs fluently with the android OS and even with a full HD Live Wallpaper it kept performing at its best.• S Pen active stylus with deep system integrationThe S-Pen is a piece of art. The best touch pen you’ll find out there, the precision is awesome, and customization in S-Note is endless, Its does everything you need for taking notes, changing color with the press of a button, changing letter types when using the curser. Inserting bullets and number.It’s like having your own personal touch proof Microsoft office. With the S-pen you can also do the famous AirView. By simply hovering over the text and date on your calendar you can preview what is actually on the specific date. But also in the photo/video gallery you can preview what’s in a folder or view the video without having to open it.• 8 MP wide-angle lens autofocus camera with LED flash, face, smile and blink detectionThe camera has a lot of features with AF and a bunch of other options you can take pictures that would leave professional photographers stunned, from night view till panorama, I would just take a day off and go take some pictures you’ll se that like the S-Pen the camera also have some hidden secrets.• 1080p HD video recording at 30fpsHD recording like the HD pictures doesn’t stay behind, there is 120fps, for high speed recording if you want to add some slow motion effect to your video, but there is also in recording zooming, so you’ll never have to stop and start again.Of course there are a lot more cool features in the galaxy like:• 16/32GB internal storage, microSD slot• Dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n support• GPS with A-GPS connectivity; GLONASS support, Digital compass• NFC support• Stereo Bluetooth v4.0• microUSB port with USB host and TV-out (1080p) support, MHL, charging• Accelerometer, gyroscope and proximity sensor• Standard 3.5 mm audio jack• Great audio quality• Slim at only 9.4mm• 1.9MP secondary video-call camera• Document editor and file manager comes preinstalled• Extremely rich video and audio codec support• Huge 3100 mAh battery can give up to 16 hours of regular day use (Tested)But there are also some drawbacks like:• Large size makes single-hand operation problematic• No dedicated camera key• All plastic construction (would have probably weighed a ton otherwise, though)• No FM radio (the N7100 has one)And of course, only the international version has FM radio capability.",3

Samsung Galaxy S3 I535 16GB Verizon Wireless 4G LTE Smartphone - Blue,Samsung,221.99,2,"Perhaps its the phone or perhaps it Otterbox. In either case, I have had 2 phones break in my Otterbox in surprising situations. One it fell on a carpet while I was standing up and another time I was exiting my car and it was still attached to my aux. cable and fell about a foot. The LCD screen busted the first time and the screen shattered the second time.The screen lags quite a bit and I was extremely disappointed that the seller was not honest about the phone modifications regarding the software. My phone came rooted and now I cannot use it while abroad. I guess now that it is broken I have to buy another one anyways and will just get one that woRks while abroad. However, the biggest problem that I had with the phone was the keyboard. It often force quits and I will try to type a sentence but it gets stuck on a letter and types the letter a bagillion times instead of the sentence. Instead of saying - Hey, want to meet up at three? It would type something like - Hey, want to mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Ya I have to say I absolutely loved that feature on top of the fact that the delete button stopped working as well so I'd have to send those idiotic texts and try to type what I really meant to say.I will never be buying from this seller again DUE to the fact that the phone came rooted and this caused many problems with getting insurance for my phone, having a cell while abroad and maybe was the cause behind the lagging screen.It's not that I don't like Samsung, but I can't trust in the Galaxy S3 or Otterbox. I have had terrible experiences all around with the two Galaxy S3s I've owned and this particular phone has to be the worst due to the keyboard, my phone being rooted WITHOUT the seller advertising it and well now another broken phone. I've seen people throw their Samsung phones because they placed so much trust in the Otterbox product and well their phone has never broke.Thanks, but no thanks. I will be staying away from this seller and the Galaxy S3.",1

"Motorola KRZR K1 Unlocked Phone with 2 MP Camera, MP3/Video Player, and MicroSD Slot--International Version with No Warranty (Cosmic Blue)",Motorola,44,5,"I'm not someone who finds himself phone shopping very often, and really liked my last Nokia... but it went thru the wash and wasn't salvageable. So I went shopping. I hate the phones the networks have at the stores, I wanted something different, something with pizazz!I really love this phone - smaller than anticipated, but very much the scale that I prefer. Key features that I find a 'must have' in any phone is multi number contacts and speakerphone. This does both and then some. I was debating between the blue and the silver - and went with the blue, and I'm glad I did. However, it is very very susceptible to fingerprints, so I highly recommend the BodyGlove Cellsuit to keep it nice and free of smears. This is an unlocked phone, so the keypad and some of the programming is not US only - the dictionary for example is in Chinese I believe. It comes with a wide array of ring tones and the sound quality exceeded expectations. The camera also exceeds expectations and has a picture editor on board - cheesey frames, b&w, brightness, sharpness and sepia - but these functions do eat up battery life quickly.I am very much a Nokia man, and have been hesitant to buy Motorola, but Nokia currently has nothing that interests me, style wise and the 2 gig micro sd ability intrigued me... by the way, have I told you how much I love this phone?

Purely for this, I'd rate it highly. It is sad that in 2013 we still have button based multitasking and app interaction paradigms on Android.It could've used a little more processor power as it lags sometimes. There are also some bugs, but nothing disastrous.I really wish Nokia hadn't killed of one of the phones that represented how the future smartphone should be, something that sits in the background, not taking over your life, yet displays the information you need when you want it (the always on screen, combined with Billboard is killer!) and is a pleasure to interact with.If you want apps, look elsewhere.

Lo recibí incluso un poco antes del tiempo estimado. Llegó en excelentes condiciones, recibí hasta una memoria Micro-Sd que no sabía que incluía.El teléfono es más bello de lo que me lo imaginaba. Super funcional por el sistema operativo Android que le puedes colocar cualquier tipo de aplicaciones que te imagines. La pantalla responde perfectamente. En los primeros días me costó un poco acostumbrarme a escribir los mensajes por el teclado virtual pero luego es algo normal hasta que los dedos se acostumbran, el único detalle es que tienes siempre que ver la pantalla para escribir.Otra cosa excelente es que puedes rotar la pantalla para tener un pánel mas grande en la escritura y así mayor facilidad al escribir.El único detalle que le he visto al teléfono es que no le puedes asignar tonos de llamadas específicos a un contacto, y tampoco imágenes. sólo fotos tomadas con el teléfono.Me fascina porque puedes personalizar tooooodo, la ubicación de los íconos, las esquinas, los widgets...Otra cosa que me fascina son las notificaciones que llegan en la parte superior y no tienes que salirte de la aplicación en la que estabas para poder leer la notificación del evento.El auricular se escucha super fuerte y claro.El otro detalle que ví fué que desde el panel numérico para llamar no tienes acceso a la agenda...es decir, si quieres llamar a alguien tienes que meterte a la agenda y de allí darle a llamar. Solo es difente, tampoco es que esté mal.La conexión Wifi la uso siempre, excelente!!. De tamaño es perfecto, ni muy grande ni muy pequeño! que en principio fué lo que me llevó a este modelo del Xperia.La cámara toma fotos buenas mas es necesario que la sostengas muy bien y no haya movimiento alguno porque o si no sale movida. Y el único detalle es que no posee flash.En definitiva, este teléfono superó mis espectativas!!!

"Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679",Samsung,119.99,4,"Let me start off by saying that I am not very tech-savy. I am on the Tmobile prepaid unlimited everything. I had been looking for an internet capable phone for quite sometime, as I was paying for a data plan I was not using. I purchased this phone after much research on android phones. What sold me on this phone was the price. Because I have the prepaid plan, I was going to have to pay in full for an unlocked android phone, which can be over $300. I found this phone on Amazon, and was imediatally in love with it, because it can everything that I wanted it to do and it was at an affordable price of $200.I like this phone for many reasons. It is a 4G capable phone so I get signal almost everywhere. I like the way that the texting is set up (gingerbread interface, I think that is what it is called). This phone comes preloaded with swype, which i had never used before until now. Swype is pretty easy to use I just drag your fingure across the letters in the word that I are trying to spell and it writes out the word for me, so no more hunt and peck. Another thing that I like about the phone is that it is wi-fi capable. I like many other things about this phone, these are just some examples.I have only had a cupple of problems with this phone. Sometimes the phone is not very responsive to my touches on the touch screen, though is rare. The only other problems that I have with the phone are that occasionally my phone will not send texts and rarely it will freeze up. Both of these problems are fixible by simply restarting the phone or pulling the battery. I have had no other problems with phone other than those things.Over all I think that this is a pretty nice andriod phone, and totally worth the money. It is a great deal for all the things that you get.",2

"Nokia 7705 Twist Phone, Black (Verizon Wireless) Works With Page Plus And Red Pocket cdma Verizon",Nokia,87.99,5,"Sound quality good. Resolution good. User interface good. This phone satisfied my requirements: Ease of use. Intuitive operation. Design targeted to text, phone call and messaging.Its diminutive size naturally complements a small footprint that doubles with the flick of the user's finger. Remarkably, I have no trouble hearing the different tone notifications (set up by the user) and am able to respond as quickly as my recently purchased Android smart phone. The ability to tag photos with each caller, immediately route to voice mail or respond, or answer seem to flow so easily that I feel I have lost nothing in comparison to my wife's iPhone or my Android. Also remarkably, the speaker on this Twist performs better than my new smart phone.Ironically, when considering its age, the younger crowd finds the square phone appealing. Also, the swivel ring lights up with user specified colors depending on who is calling.One Con for Some: Though I don't play apps on my phones, the user of the Twist will find apps for the Twist expensive compared to today's apps for both iPhone and Android.Within one week of use, this is my favorite phone. Considering it was implemented in 2009, I may buy another one as backup when this one falls apart.One last point: While my other phones are on contract, I chose to pay-as-I-go each month with Horizon. I had noticed another reviewer stating such a plan was not available. Well, it is. For $40, I get unlimited text and calls, and 1G of download.*** UPDATE ***Another positive to this phone is the battery life. Though I don't employ the phone's many features, and considering the features that I do employ are not constantly used, I still find the battery life remarkable. I can leave the phone on for several days without the need to charge it. Currently, I have had the phone on three days (without charging involved) and the battery symbol is down only one bar (four possible).From an ergonomic view, the diminutive phone size (when closed), and when coupled with a phone pouch (appropriate phone case to hold the phone) that you wear is very comfortable. I suppose that point seems obvious since the phone is a smaller footprint. Still, I wanted you to know you will not feel the bumping and bulging experienced with the normal smart phone case. Since I wear a suit to work, I like the small footprint that does not force my suit jacket to accommodate what is usually a bigger phone case in today's world.Another CON: That phone's backplate does shift when using the keyboard. By *shift* I mean it is flimsy. But, it has not fallen off and serves its purpose.",2

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,129,5,"I'll spare the specs--they're easily found elsewhere. The phone's design, however, is of a very well balanced upper-mid range telephone for a lower-mid level price. The sound is fantastic, it has great cameras and the radio will communicate on every T-Mobile and AT&T frequency band in the US (which should include providers that use AT&T or T-Mobile's underlying networks). For T-Mobile customers, the LTE Band 12 (700 MHz) indeed penetrates buildings like only AT&T customers previously enjoyed, when in enable US locations (search for T-Mobile 700 Mhz for more details). The updated radio and being designed for Android version 5 makes this phone more than just a cheaper version of the previous generation's phone, but instead a modern phone albeit a bit easy on the computing horsepower. If you need top processing power, look to the big names' flagship phones; otherwise the Idol 3 will likely fill any other needs (but consider adding an SD Card if you have a lot of media or photos)",3
